## Notes & shoutouts

Since this is our first group project using ember framework and we have not learned much about javascript. We got a lot of problems when we first start doing this project. We have a lot of great ideas but we were limited since we did not learn javascript before. However, we do have a basic understanding of the javascript and based on our C++, C#, PHP experience, we finally finish it, but we still have a lot of improvement that needs to make.
